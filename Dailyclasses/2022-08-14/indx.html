        Yes. We're always interested in improving this generator and one of the
        best ways to do that is to add new and interesting paragraphs to the
        generator. If you'd like to contribute some random paragraphs, please
        contact us.
      </p>
      <p>
        Generating random paragraphs can be an excellent way for writers to get
        their creative flow going at the beginning of the day. The writer has no
        idea what topic the random paragraph will be about when it appears. This
        forces the writer to use creativity to complete one of three common
        writing challenges. The writer can use the paragraph as the first one of
        a short story and build upon it. A second option is to use the random
        paragraph somewhere in a short story they create. The third option is to
        have the random paragraph be the ending paragraph in a short story. No
        matter which of these challenges is undertaken, the writer is forced to
        use creativity to incorporate the paragraph into their writing.
      </p>

      <p>
        A random paragraph can also be an excellent way for a writer to tackle
        writers' block. Writing block can often happen due to being stuck with a
        current project that the writer is trying to complete. By inserting a
        completely random paragraph from which to begin, it can take down some
        of the issues that may have been causing the writers' block in the first
        place.
      </p>

      <p>
        Another productive way to use this tool to begin a daily writing
        routine. One way is to generate a random paragraph with the intention to
        try to rewrite it while still keeping the original meaning. The purpose
        here is to just get the writing started so that when the writer goes
        onto their day's writing projects, words are already flowing from their
        fingers.
